# Test Fixtures

## Required Test Files

### test.pdf

Place a test PDF file here named `test.pdf` to enable full test coverage.

The PDF should ideally:
- Be 2-3 pages long
- Be a simple document (not overly complex)
- Be small in size (< 1MB recommended)

You can use any PDF file you have available, or create one using:
- Word/Google Docs exported to PDF
- Online converters
- Sample PDFs from the web

**Note**: Without this file, tests will still run but will skip PDF-related functionality tests.

## Why is the test PDF not included?

The test PDF is not included in the repository to:
1. Keep the repository size small
2. Avoid potential copyright issues
3. Allow you to test with your own specific PDF requirements
